# Introduction to the topic
Our main topic for this analysis of data is about the consumption of cocoa and chocolate.

This project aims to explore key questions related to the cocoa and chocolate markets. Specifically, we focus on the following points:

* Cost pressure in the cocoa market
    - We will examine price data to understand whether the cocoa market is experiencing significant cost pressures.

* Market size per capita
   - We will identify the top chocolate-consuming countries, both in absolute terms and relative to population size.
* Seasonality in consumption
    - We aim to explore whether chocolate consumption is influenced by seasonal factors. For this, we will analyse two sets of countries:

        - United Kingdom and New Zealand: smaller territories where weather patterns may have an impact on consumption.

        - USA, Canada, India, Australia: larger countries where national holidays, long periods of free time, and population size may affect consumption trends.

By examining these aspects, we aim to provide insights into the dynamics of chocolate consumption and the factors that influence it across different countries and contexts.
